# Iznik-Pottery-IMAGINE

## Code and results from my internship at Imagine Laboratory (ENPC).

### Goal of the project

---

I aim to generate a dataset of usable Iznik pottery photos, and then train an adversarial network to create such Iznik tiles.

You'll find two files here :

1. The file `Iznik Dataset Generator` which contains all the code to generate a dataset through active learning (assisted by an operator). All parameters can be changed and this method can adapt to any dataset you want to create.

2. The file `Iznik Tile GAN` which is the core of the Generative Adversarial Network trained to generate his own Iznik tiles and mosa√Øcs.

- To launch the code, juste enter `python ./main.py` in the terminal, when you're in the main folder.
